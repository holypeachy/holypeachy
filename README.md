**` Love Software Engineering `**  **` I make anything I find interesting: Web Apps | Video Games | Bots | Tooling `**  

I've played around with computers all my life and programming seemed like the logical next step. I've been programming for about 7 years and have been taking it more seriously for about 4. I love to understand the architecture of code, I hate black boxes, and I love docs (I know, crazy). My dream is to contribue to the Linux kernel one day, but I haven't had the chance to learn C (and Rust later on) which I would love to get into. I have a lot of ambitions that require a lot of learning.

### 🐙 My Github
**🗃️ On my GitHub** you will find C# .NET, ASP.NET, and Unity personal projects.

**🎩 I am part** of a small game dev team I formed with some friends from Uni: <a href="https://github.com/TeaPot-TopHats"><strong>TeaPot TopHats</strong></a>  
> We are not doing anything together as of right now but we still communicate actively about the personal projects we are working on. Our hope is to gain experience individually before attempting another project.

### 🧑‍💻 Currently Working On:  
- Personal ASP.NET projects to practice my understanding of the framework. Latest one is [BookCat](https://github.com/holypeachy/BookCat).
- A Poker game. Currently a prototype: [PokerProto](https://github.com/holypeachy/PokerProto).

### 🗄️ Future Work:  
- The poker engine for my game: [PokerAlgo](https://github.com/holypeachy/PokerAlgo). v1.0 is released on Nuget but there are a few major features I would like to add.
- I would like to port my discord bot ([cakebot](https://github.com/holypeachy/cakebot)), originally written in Python to C#.
- A few personal projects that involve hardware and low level code.
