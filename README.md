**`Curiosity Fueled`** **`Professional Scientist | Amateur Programmer`**

I am a 25 year old who loves science, technology, and is fascinated by the complex. I graduated in 2023 from **Bellarmine University** with a Major in *Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,* and a *Minor in Chemistry*. Everyday I pursue my passion for computers and programming by completing personal projects and projects with friends.  

I started learning to program around 7 years ago, when I realized it was the logical next step on my journey with computers. During those first years I learned bits and pieces, enough to have fun. But around 4 years ago I started to take programming more seriously and I aim to become a competent programmer. As of right now, I have a grasp on the major concepts in programming and I'm learning more of the architecture and patterns that are used. I enjoy seeing how my understanding of this world expands more and more everyday.  

### 🧑‍💻 Currently Working On:  
- Personal ASP.NET projects to practice my understanding of the framework.
- A Poker game. Currently a prototype: [PokerProto](https://github.com/holypeachy/PokerProto).

#### 🗄️ On Hold:  
- The poker engine for my game: [PokerAlgo](https://github.com/holypeachy/PokerAlgo). v1.0 is released on Nuget but there are a few major features I would like to add.
- A Discord Bot using Python ([cakebot](https://github.com/holypeachy/cakebot)). I would like to port the bot to C#.
- I have a few personal projects that involve hardware and low level code.

### 🐙 My Github
**🗃️ On my GitHub** you will find C# .NET, Unity, and ASP.NET personal projects. I am also using python for a discord bot I'm working on with a friend but I am not yet too comfortable with it.

**🎩 I am part** of a small game dev team I formed with some friends from Uni: <a href="https://github.com/TeaPot-TopHats"><strong>TeaPot TopHats</strong></a>  
> We are not doing anything together as of right now but we still communicate actively about the personal projects we are working on. Our hope is to gain experience individually before attempting another project.
